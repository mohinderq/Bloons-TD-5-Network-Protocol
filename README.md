# Bloons-TD-5-Network-Protocol
Reverse engineering the network protocol of Bloons TD 5. My goal is to create a custom game client. 

Feel free to contribute to this project. Install a Windows Packet Inspector. I've used Microsoft Network Monitor.
Open the game inside your browser and analyze the traffic sent to, and from, the server.
